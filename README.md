## Project Overview

As part of the IBM Data Science Certification Final Project, 
I applied my newly acquired skills to analyze a SpaceX dataset. 
My analysis focused on determining the likelihood of a first 
stage landing, estimating the final cost of a launch, and evaluating 
whether the success of a launch depends on the location and proximity 
of the launch site.
